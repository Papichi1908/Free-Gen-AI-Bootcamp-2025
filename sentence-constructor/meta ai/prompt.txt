Sentence Structure
For the first sentence, "There are bears at the door," you can use the following structure:
Topic ( bears ) + wa/ ga + Location (at the door) + Verb (exist)
Remember to use the correct particle to indicate the location.
For the second sentence, "Did you leave the garbage out?" you can use the following structure:
